###Monadic Visualisation

This is a simple visualisation script to show links between items, not a 
reference to monads in Functional Programming. 

An example will be posted but the function takes a JSON object and 
creates the visualisations in the form of monads.

It is derived from the ideas at the ArchaID project
(http://www.archaid.org/?portfolio=monadic-visualization).

###Requirements

Uses both JQuery and Raphael Javascript libraries.

###Issues

Issues will be posted in the issue queue on Github
